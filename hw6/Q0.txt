Decision trees should work fairly well with both datasets as each attribute is binary so the trees will stay fairly compact. For the education dataset there is likely a correlation between something like final grade and the grade on the class final exam. A cursory look through the data supports a relationship between final grade and final exam grade. The music dataset is probably not going to work as well since there are rarely single deciding factors in song popularity. In fact the music hit problem may be very tough since generating hits in the real world seems to be mostly luck. The given data has very littl classical music so it is likely that that is a sign of not being a hit.
